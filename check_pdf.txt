Through this GWAC, Federal government agencies can award Task Orders to acquire IT services based 
solutions.  
 
 
B.3
 
ECONOMY ACT
 
 
The Economy Act does not a
pply to Governmentwide acquisition contracts (GWACs).  GWACs are 
multiple award 
t
ask 
o
rder or delivery order contracts used by other agencies to procure information 
technology products and services outside of the Economy Act. (Refer to
 
Federal Acquisition 
Regulation 
(

(a) Maximum. The maximum contract ceiling value of all contracts in this multiple award p
rocurement is 
established at $
15
 
Billion dollars.
 
 
(b) Minimum. The minimum guaranteed award amount for this IDIQ contract is
 
$2,500
 
dollars per 
Contractor for the full term of the Master Contract. The exercise of the option period does not re
-
establish 
the contract minimum. 
 
 
Should the contract expire or be unilaterally terminated for convenience by the Government without the 
contractor receiving the minimum guaranteed award amount, the contractor may present a claim to the 
contracting officer for an amount not to exceed the minimum guaranteed award amount. The minimum 
guaranteed award amount is not applicable if the contract i

LABOR CATEGORIES (
LCAT or 
LCATs)
 
 
B.6.1
 
Three Labor Category Types
 
 
To enhance 
the consistency o
f labor and service cost/price offers and reporting, the Master Contract 
provides the Standard IT Service Labor Categories (see Section J
-
3
). These labor categories (LCATs), 
which are a subset of the Standard Occupational Classifications (SOCs) issued by t
he Department of 
Labor (DOL) Bureau, Labor Statistics Division, facilitate the standardization of labor types, descriptions, 
and rates across the entire contract vehicle. This approach provides the government more accurate cost 
forecasting, reporting, and 
tracking. Additionally, the Master Contract also provides for Non
-
Standard IT 
Service LCATs and Ancillary Service LCATs, as described below. 
 
 
The Contractor is 
always
 
bound by Maximum Rates on labor hours used in all Time
-
and material (T&M) 
and Labor Hour
 
(L
-
H) Task Order contract types, including any T&M and L
-
H Contract Line Items (CLINS) 
that may be integrated into a single Task Order among Cost
-
type and/or Fixed
-
price CLINS. (See 
SubSection B.1
1
.5.1 Maximum Rates for Time
-
and material and Labor Hour 
Contract Types).
 
 
Alliant 2 
Small Business 
GWAC 
provides the following three (3) types of LCATs:
 
 
(1) 
 
Standard IT Service LCATs
 

 
This labor category type includes the defined IT Service LCATs 
(see Section J
-
3
). Each of the defined Standard IT Service LCATs is further stratified to include 
four (4) skill levels. These may be modified through the term of this Master Contract to 
accommodate emerging IT Service LCATs 
 
as defined by the market. The Contractor shall
 
utilize 
the Standard IT Service LCATs to the maximum extent possible. 
 
Additional Standard IT Service 
LCATs may be added over the term of this contract if the GSA GWAC Program approved and 
appended to the contract via modification by the GSA GWAC PCO. (Se
e Section B.6.3).
 
 
(2) 
Non
-
Standard IT Service LCATs
 
-
 
This labor category type includes any IT Service labor 
category that is not listed within the Standard IT Service LCATs (see Section J
-
3
). A Non
-
standard IT Service LCAT must be approved by the OCO at 
the Task Order level.
 
 
(3) 
Ancillary Service LCATs
 

 
This labor category type includes ancillary labor support, and does 
not include any of the defined Standard IT Service LCATs or Non
-
Standard IT Service 
LCATs. 
 
Ancillary Service LCATs may be used only wh
en the principal purpose of the Task Order 
is to furnish IT services
-
based solutions.

The OCO will ensure that additional labor categories are in compliance with Service Contract 
Labor Standards and Wage Rate Requirements (Construction), and, where appli
cable, include 
appropriate clauses and wage determinations consistent with B.7 and/or B.8.
 
 
B.6.1.1 
 
Standard IT Service Labor Categories (LCATs)
 
Standard IT Service LCATs are the labor categories referenced in Section J
-
3
. They are presented as 
historical
ly
-
based relevant positions that support Information Technology (IT) procurement 
requirements. 
 
IT is a dynamic discipline that will likely require additional uniquely defined IT Service labor 
categories that emerge at some point through the term of this M
aster Contract. Additional Standard IT 
Service labor categories may be added by the government via contract modification. The process to 
recommend the addition of new IT LCATs to the Master Contract is discussed in detail under section 
B.6.3, Process to ad
d Standard IT Service LCATs to the Master Contract. 
 
(i) 
  
The 
primary
 
source of the Standard IT Service LCATs is the Department of Labor (DoL) 
Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Service Occupational System. 
The Standard Occupational 
Classification (SOC) sys
tem is used by Federal statistical agencies to classify workers into 
occupational categories for the purpose of collecting, calculating, or disseminating data.
 
 
 
(ii) 
 
The Standard IT Service LCATs (see Section J
-
3
) contains the comprehensive IT Service 
LCATs required to meet all information technology service based requirements. 
 
Therefore, every 
effort shall be made by the OCOs and Contractors to use the Standard IT Service LCATs (see 
Section J
-
3
) 
 
 
B.6.1.2 
  
Non
-
Standard IT Service LCATs
 
 
Any IT Servic
es LCAT that does not fit within the Standard IT Service LCATs is not approved for use on 
task orders 
without approval of the OCO
 
awarding the Task Order.
 
 
The Master Contract Standard IT Service LCATs are robust and were written to encompass the broad 
sco
pe of information technology. Additional labor categories would need to bring to bear skill sets that are 
so specialized or rare that they are not already encompassed in any existing Master Contract labor 
category. OCOs may consider additional labor catego
ries on task orders when deemed necessary to 
provide IT services or an IT services
-
based solution. OCOs will perform due diligence in determining that 
Non
-
standard IT service labor categories are required.
 
 
B.6.1.3 
 
Ancillary Service Labor Categories
 
 
The 
GSA GWAC is to be used by agencies in meeting professional Information Technology 
service 
 
objectives. 
 
Use of the non
-
IT ancillary service LCATs must be (1) 
 
integral and necessary; (2) 
part of a total integrated solution within the scope of the Master Co
ntract; and (3) 
 
not a labor category 
specified in the Master Contract. 
 
The Contractor should propose and identify each ancillary support 
service separately and the OCO should identify each ancillary support service by a separate CLIN on the 
task order aw
ard.
 
 
Included in ancillary services may be those LCATs covered under construction and service type 
employees identified by the Department of Labor wage determinations.

B.6.
3 Process to add Standard IT Service LCATs to the Master Contract
 
GSA reserves the right to add new IT Service LCAT to the list of Standard IT Service LCATs when 
determined to be in the best interest of the Government.
 
 
As the information technology market
 
evolves, GSA encourages the Contractor and ordering agencies to 
recommend new IT Service LCAT that they believe should be added to the list of Standard IT Service 
LCATs. With any new 
 
IT Service LCAT, GSA requests a justification narrative be included to 
provide the 
rationale for adding the new IT Service LCAT. If approved by the GSA GWAC PCO, the newly adopted IT 
Service LCAT will be added to the Standard IT Service LCATs and each contract holder will be afforded 
the opportunity to submit and negotiate la
bor hour pricing for the new IT Service LCAT. 
 
Ultimately, for 
those Contractors who establish pricing with the GSA GWAC PCO, a contract modification will be 
executed to add the new Standard IT Service LCAT. 
 
 
B.7
 
LABOR SUBJECT TO THE WAGE RATE 
REQUIREMENTS (CONSTRUCTION)
 
 
 
The Master Contract does not include wage determinations or all applicable clauses for labor categories 
subject to the Wage Rate Requirements (Construction). Each Task Order must be tailored to include the 
appropriate clauses 
and wage determinations. To the extent that construction, alteration, and repair are 
subject to the wage rate requirements and within scope of a Task Order and the Master Contract, the 
OCO must identify such work under a separate CLIN on the Task Order and
 
incorporate the appropriate 
wage determinations in accordance with FAR 22.4, Labor Standards for Contracts Involving Construction.
 
 
 
Any construction, alteration, and repair are only in scope as necessary to offer an integrated information 
technology solu
tion provided that it is integral to and necessary for the effort stated in the Task Order; and 
shall be firm fixed price, even if other aspects of the Task Order are of another Task Order type. 
 
  
 
B.8
 
LABOR SUBJECT TO THE SERVICE CONTRACT LABOR STANDARDS
 
(SCLS)
 
 
 
The Master Contract labor categories are considered bona fide executive, administrative, professional 
labor and generally exempt from the SCLS
 
if used to perform professional IT services, except as noted in 
Attachment J
-
3.
 
The Master Contract doe
s not include wage determinations or all applicable clauses for 
labor categories subject to the SCLS. Each Task Order must be tailored to include the appropriate 
clauses and wage determinations.
 
 
 
To the extent that any labor is subject to the SCLS and 
within scope of a Task Order and the Master 
Contract, the OCO must identify such work under a separate CLIN on the Task Order and incorporate 
wage determination in accordance with FAR 22.10, Service Contract Labor Standards.

TASK ORDER PRICING (ALL ORDER TYPES)
 
 
 
The issuing agency will negotiate cost or pricing with the Contractor and make the determination for cost 
or price reasonableness for each Task Order type.  Adequate price competition at the task order level, in 
response to an individual requirement, es
tablishes the most accurate, fair, and reasonable pricing for that 
requirement. 
 
 
 
The OCO should identify the applicable contract type for all CLINs in each 
Alliant 2 Small Business
 
GWAC 
task order.  
 
 
When adequate price competition exists (see FAR 
15.403
-
1(b)(1)), generally no additional information is 
necessary to determine the reasonableness of cost or price.  If adequate price competition does not exist 
and no other exceptions apply (see FAR 15.403
-
1(b)), the OCO must request a Certificate of Cur
rent 
Cost and Pricing Data in accordance with FAR 15.403

Maximum Rates for Time

Material and Labor Hour Contract Types
 
 
Maximum Rate Definition: 

not necessarily a term used at the Task Order level. It represents and e
stablishes maximum allowable 
labor rates in the form of burdened rates for all IT Standard Service LCATs indicated in this Master 
Contract. The burdened rates include the direct labor cost, G&A, O/H, fringe benefits, and profit. These 
Maximum Rates apply e
xclusively to T&M and L
-
H contract type orders and proposals.  The Master 

-
price labor rates or ceiling labor 
rates that are established between the Contractor and issuing agency at the 
Task Order Level. 
 
 
Based on the specific Task Order requirements, only the agency OCO is authorized to exceed the Master 
Contract maximum rates for those labor categories if necessary, for example, Top Secret/SCI labor 
and/or OCONUS locations, etc.  The 
Maximum Rates already include the U.S. Government security 
classification up through the Secret level. The Contractor shall always provide to the agency OCO the 
detailed rationale in all instances if and when the Maximum Rates of labor are exceeded.
 
 
 
The 
burdened T&M maximum rates awarded at initial contract award shall serve as the basis for all future 
year pricing for those maximum rates. In order to determine future year maximum rate pricing, the 
originally awarded rates will have an escalation factor a
pplied. This escalation factor will be the average

or the previous 
three years. In Year 5 of the Master Contract, if the average annual ECI for the previous three years is 
higher than at time 
of the
 
Master Contract award, the maximum rates for Years 6 
through 15 will be 
adjusted by the difference of percentage increase. For example, if the BLS ECI index was 2.23% at time 
of proposal submission and the BLS ECI index is 3.16% in Year 5 
of the
 
Master Contract, the maximum 
rates for years 6 through 15 will 
be adjusted by 0.93% per year on a cumulative basis. If BLS ECI index in 
Year 5 
of the
 
Master Contract is equal to or below the BLS ECI index at time of award, the maximum

rates will remain unchanged. In Year 10 
of the
 
Master Contract, if the previous three year average annual 
BLS ECI index for the previous three years is higher than Year 5 
of the
 
Master Contract, the maximum 
rates for Years 11 through 15 will be adjusted by the difference of percentage increase in acco
rdance 
with the example above. If the average index in Year 10 is equal to or below the average index in Year 5, 
the maximum rates will remain unchanged.

GWAC CONTRACT ACCESS FEE (CAF)
 
 

sts are reimbursed through a Contract Access Fee (CAF) charged on orders placed 
against the Master Contract. The CAF is paid by the ordering agency, but remitted to GSA by the 
Contractor. GSA maintains the unilateral right to establish and change the CAF r
ate. GSA will provide 
at 
least a 60 day 
notice prior to the effective date of any change to the CAF payment process. Changes to 
the CAF only apply to orders awarded after the 
change 
is 
announced
.
 
 
The CAF rate, which is 0.75%
 
at time of Master Contract Awa
rd
, is applied to the total amount 
reported
 
on each invoice.
 
 
Based on the established CAF rate, the Contractor shall include the CAF in each proposal. The 
Contractor shall include the CAF as a separate cost element on all proposals to the government, 
regardless of contract type. The CAF shall never be treated as a negotiable element between the 
Contractor and the ordering agency.
 
 
If a customer organization has negotiated a CAF rate based on a special written agreement and/or 
Memorandum of Agreement by
 
the GWAC Program that is other than the established CAF rate, GSA will 
provide advance notification. 
 
 
 
The Contractor remits the CAF to GSA in accordance with Section G.

of strategy. Enterprise architecture applies architecture principles
 
and practices to guide organizations 
through the business, information, process, and technology changes necessary to execute their 
strategies.  This includes everything from a small mobile application development project to the design, 
installation and mi
gration to a complex network serving hundreds of thousands of users.  These practices 
utilize the various aspects of an enterprise to identify, motivate, and achieve these changes.
 
 
Each reference model represents and includes a number of functional areas 
required to meet an 
objective.

FEA REFERENCE MODEL DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS
 
 
Enterprise Architecture (EA) supports planning and decision
-
making through documentation and 
information that provides an abstracted view of an enterprise at various levels of
 
scope and detail.  The 

policy guidance and management tools for increasing shared approaches to IT service delivery, presents 
an overall approach to deve
loping and using Enterprise Architecture in the Federal Government.  The 
Common Approach promotes increased levels of mission effectiveness by standardizing the development 
and use of architectures within and between Federal Agencies.  This includes princi
ples for using EA to 
help agencies eliminate waste and duplication, increase shared services, close performance gaps, and 
promote engagement among government, industry, and citizens.

The Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework v2 describes a suite of 
tools to help government planners 
implement the Common Approach.   At its core is the Consolidated Reference Model (CRM), which 
equips OMB and Federal agencies with a common language and framework to describe and analyze 
investments.  It consists of a set 

domains in the framework:
 
 

 
Strategy
 

 
Business
 

 
Data
 

 
Applications
 

 
Infrastructure
 

 
Security 
 
 
These are designed to facilitate cross
-
agency analysis and the identification of duplicative 
investments, 
gaps
 
and opportunities for collaboration within and across agencies.  Also, by applying all six reference 
models, agencies can establish a line of sight from the strategic goals at the highest organizational level 
to the software and hardware 
infrastructure that enable achievement of those goals.  Collectively, the 
reference models comprise a framework for describing important elements of federal agency operations 
in a common and consistent way.   
 
 

artifacts to document its environment within the framework presented by the CRM. Each subarchitecture 
domain represents a specific area of the overall fra
mework and has particular 
artifacts, based
 
on EA best 
practices, which
 
are described and recommended in the Framework and Artifacts document. The type 
and depth of documentation actually used by the agency should be guided by the need or detail and 
answers
 
to questions about requirements, applicable standards, timeframes, and available resources.
 
 
The real value to the agency of developing an Enterprise Architecture is to facilitate planning for the future 
in a way that transforms the government while makin
g it more efficient.  The agency can use the EA 
process to describe the enterprise as it currently is and determine what the enterprise should look like in 
the future, so that it can make plans to transition from the current state to the future state. The 
Collaborative Planning Methodology provides steps for planners to use throughout the planning process 
to flesh out a transition strategy that will enable the future state to become reality. It is a simple, 
repeatable process that consists of integrated, mu
lti
-
disciplinary analysis that involves 
sponsors, 
stakeholders
, planners, and implementers.  
 
 
The agency will create an Enterprise Roadmap to document the current and future architecture states at 
a high level and presents the transition plan for how the 
agency will move from the present to the future in 

the EA, both current and future state versions, with a plan developed through the Collaborative Planni
ng 
Methodology.  This creates awareness, visibility and transparency within an organization to facilitate 
cross
-
organization planning and collaboration.  It maps strategy to projects and budget and helps identify 
gaps between investment and execution, as w
ell as dependencies and risks between projects.
 
 
All in all, the Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework v2 helps to accelerate agency business 
transformation and new technology enablement by providing standardization, analysis and reporting 
tools, an en
terprise roadmap, and a repeatable architecture project method that is more agile and useful 
and will produce more authoritative information for intra
-
 
and inter
-
agency planning, decision making, and 
management.

of solutions and 
services, organizations need actionable, consistent, and rigorous plans to implement Strategic Plans and 
solve priority needs.  These integrated plans should support efforts to leverage other Federal, state, local, 
tribal, and internationa
l experiences and results as a means of reusing rather than inventing from scratch.  
Plans should be consistent and rigorous descriptions of the structure of the organization or enterprise, 
how IT resources will be efficiently used, and how the use of asse
ts such as IT will ultimately achieve 
stated strategies and needs.
 
 
Consolidated Reference Models 
 
 
The Consolidated Reference Model of the FEAF equips OMB and Federal agencies with a common 
language and framework to describe and analyze investments.  It consists of a set of interrelated 

-
agency analysis and
 
the identification of duplicative 
investments, gaps and opportunities for collaboration within and across agencies.  Collectively, the 
reference models comprise a framework for describing important elements of federal agency operations 
in a common and con
sistent way. Through the use of the FEAF and its vocabulary, IT portfolios can be 
better managed and leveraged across the federal government, enhancing collaboration and ultimately 
transforming the Federal government.  
 
 
 
The five reference models in versi
on 1 the 
FEA
 
have been regrouped and expanded into six in the current 
version of the 
FEA
.
 
 
 
 
 
With edits for brevity, the following reference model
 
summarized
 
descriptions were taken from 

FEA Consolidated Reference Model Document Version 2. dated Ja
nuary 29, 2013
.  
 
 
Significantly more detail about the structure, taxonomy, and associated methods of the reference 
models is available at

The motivating purpose of adopting 
The FEA as scope guidance is to help establish business driver 
alignment with any number of the reference models which support all possible underlying technologies 
required to meet an agency objective as well as offering the baseline for the technical voca
bulary required 
in any given task.
 
  
 
 
Performance Reference Model (PRM)
 
 
 
The PRM 
is designed to provide linkage between investments or activities and the strategic vision 
established by agencies and the Federal government. 
 
Historically, linking informat
ion management 
investments and activities has been anecdotal due to a lack of standard approach to describing Agency 
and cross agency performance attributes. 
 
The GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 requires the 
government to publish performance information thr
ough a central web site and make strategic plans and 
performance reports available in machine readable formats. 
 
This advance enables more comprehensive 
and consistent linking of investments and activities to Agency strategic goals and objectives, Agency 
p
riority Goals, Cross Agency Priority goals and management areas of focus. 
 
The PRM leverages the 
requirements of the GPRA Modernization Act to establish mechanisms to link directly to the authoritative 
performance elements published in compliance with the 
law and provides the means for use of future 
developments in the mandated central performance website Performance.gov.
 
 
There are three areas to the Performance Reference Model. 
 
The first is the Goal. 
 
This enables grouping 
of investments and activities t
hrough a common and authoritative framework established by agencies in 
compliance with OMB direction and the GPRA Modernization Act. 
 
It allows the identification of common 
performance elements across investments or activities, and in the future will enabl
e cross platform 
information linkages between systems such as Performance.gov and the IT Dashboard.
 
 
This linkage provides the logical relationships necessary to consistently provide much richer
 
insights
 
into details of the supported performance areas than previously feasible.
 
 
The second area of the Performance Reference Model is Measurement Area. 
 
This describes the manner 
in which the investment or activity supports the achievement of the supported per
formance element 
identified by the Agency Goal. 
  
Measurement Areas apply to the more detailed performance indicators 
associated with the investment of activity rather than the functions of the investment or activity. 
Investment or activity performance ind
icators should have a clear linkage to the activities, of course, but it 
is important to recognize that investments or activities may align to multiple measurement areas. 
 
 
 
The third area, Measurement Category, refines Measurement Area. 
 
Any Measurement C
ategory may be 
applied to any Goal. 
 
 
 
The PRM, like all other reference models, is intended to work in concert with other reference models. The 
combined descriptive qualities of the multiple perspectives afforded by assigning different reference 
model per
spectives to investments or activities can provide rich insights into what, why and how the 
investments or activities are undertaken. 
 
Previous versions of the PRM included mission function 
characteristics that were redundant to the BRM. 
 
In this version o
f the PRM the Measurement Category 
codes have been streamlined to better identify the means by which performance is achieved. Including 
BRM and PRM mappings with an investment or activity provides information about the strategic basis 
(why) through the Age
ncy Goal, the means (how) through the measurement category, and the mission 
functions involved (what) through the BRM taxonomy. 
 
Additional mappings to other reference models 
provide further context for the investment or activity with the SRM providing inf
ormation about risk, the 
DRM about the information involved and the ARM and IRM providing the technical details about the 
implementation.

Business R
eference Model (BRM)
 
 
 
The BRM
 
is a classification taxonomy used to describe the type of business functions and services that 
are performed in the Federal Government.
 
By describing the Federal Government using standard 
business functions rather than an 
organizational view, the BRM promotes cross
-
government 
collaboration. 
 
It enables business and IT leaders to discover opportunities for cost savings and new 
business capabilities that help to achieve strategic objectives. 
 


the Federal enterprise through the definition of outcome
-
oriented and measurable functions and 
services. 
  
 
 
While the BRM provides a standardized way of classifying government functions, it is only a model; its 
true utility and value is realized when
 
it is applied and effectively used in business analysis, design and 
decision support that help to improve the performance of an agency, bureau or program. 
 
 
 
BRM is informed by the PRM and informs the other reference models. 
 
At the high level, the BRM 
re
lationship and tie
-
in to the other reference models is illustrated in the following table:

The 
BRM
 
forms a key part in delivering expected outcomes and business value to an organization. 
 
By 
using a standard taxonomy to classify functions, investments, programs,services and other elements 
across the Federal Government, the BRM is useful in identifying o
pportunities for cost reduction, 
collaboration, shared services, and solution reuse in agency IT portfolios and intra
-
 
and inter
-
agency 
collaboration.
 
 
Data Reference Model (DRM)
 
 
 
The DRM

 
primary purpose is to promote the common identification, use, and
 
appropriate sharing of 
data
/information across the federal government. 
 
The DRM is a flexible and standards
-
based framework 
to enable information sharing and reuse via the standard description and discovery of common data and 
the promotion of uniform data
 
management practices. 
 
The DRM provides a standard means by which 
data may be described, categorized, and shared, and it facilitates discovery and exchange of core 
information across organizational boundaries. 
 
 
As a reference model, the DRM is presented 
as an abstract framework from which concrete
 
implementations
 

implementation approaches, methodologies and technologies while remaining consistent with the 
foundational principles of the DRM.
 
 
The DRM is closely linked with the other five
 
reference models of the Consolidated Reference Model 
Framework. At the high level, the DRM relationship and tie
-
in to the other reference models is illustrated 
in the following table:

of 149
 
 
 
 
The DRM provides guidance for agencies to leverage existing Data 
Assets across the government. The 

asset. This reference
-
able, conceptual approach facilitates information sharing and reuse across the 
Federal government.
 
 
Application Reference Model (ARM)
 
 
The purpose of the ARM is to provide the basis for categorizing applications and their components.  As 
agencies map their current and planned Information Systems to the ARM categories, gaps and 
redundancies will become 
evident, which will aid in identifying opportunities for sharing, reuse, and 
consolidation or renegotiation of licenses.   This information may be used in conjunction with the other 
Reference Models to identify these opportunities.
 
 
For the purposes of the
 
CRM, Application is defined as:  Software components (including 
websites, 
databases
, email, and other supporting software) resting on Infrastructure that, when aggregated and 
managed, may be used to create, use, share, and store data and information to en
able support of a 
business function.
 
 
The ARM is a categorization of different types of software, components and interfaces.   It categorizes 
software that supports or may be customized to support business. It does not include operating systems 
or software that is used to operate hardware (e.g
. firmware) because these are contained in the IRM.  It 
also does not contain mission
-
specific categorizations for systems because that information can be 
obtained from mappings to the BRM. 
 
 
The ARM is closely linked with the other five reference models o
f the Consolidated Reference Model 
Framework.  At the high level, the ARM relationship and tie
-
in to the other reference models is illustrated 
in the following table:

Infrastructure Reference Model (IRM)
 
 
The IRM is the taxonomy based reference model f
or categorizing IT infrastructure and the facilities and 
network that host the IT infrastructure.  The IRM supports definition of infrastructure technology items and 
best practice guidance to promote positive outcomes across technology implementations.
 
 
Fo
r the purposes of the CRM, Infrastructure is defined as: The generic (underlying) platform consisting of 
hardware, software and delivery platform upon which specific/customized capabilities (solutions, 
applications) may be deployed.
 
 
The IRM implementation
 
enables sharing and reuse of infrastructure to reduce costs, increase 
interoperability across the government and its partners, support efficient acquisition and 
deployment, and
 
enable greater access to information across enterprises.
 
 
In addition to provi
ding a categorization schema for IT infrastructure assets, the IRM enables analysis of 
IT infrastructure assets at a Department or Agency level as well as at a Federal Government level.  In the 
Federal context, the IRM is adopted and used to conduct Govern
ment
-
wide analysis of IT infrastructure 
assets and to identify consolidation initiatives.  In the Department or Agency context, the IRM is used to 
drive good IT infrastructure asset management practices such as identifying end
-
of
-
life assets before they 
af
fect the mission of an organization and to identify opportunities for sharing and consolidating 
infrastructure.
 
 
The IRM is closely linked with the other five reference models of the Consolidated Reference Model 
Framework (CRM).   At the high level, the IR
M relationship and tie
-
in to the other reference models is 
illustrated in the following table:

Security Reference Model (SRM)
 
 
Security is integral to all architectural domains and at all levels of an organization.  As a result, the SRM 
must be woven i
nto all of the sub
-
architectures of the overarching EA across all the other reference 
models and it must be considered up and down the different levels of the Enterprise.  Enterprise 
Architecture Governance is the perfect place for security standards, poli
cies, and norms to be developed 
and followed, since it is an enforcement point for Information Technology investments.
 
   
 
The SRM allows architects to classify or categorize security architecture at all scope levels of the Federal 
Architecture: Internatio
nal, National, Federal, Sector, Agency, Segment, System and Application. At the 
highest levels, the SRM is used to transform federal laws, regulations, and publications into specific 
policies.  At the segment level, the SRM is used to transform department 
specific policies into security 
controls and measurements.  At the system level, it is used to transform segment controls into system 
specific designs or requirements.  Each level of the SRM is critical to the overall security posture and 
health of an orga
nization and/or system.
 
 
The SRM helps business owners with risk
-
based decision
-
making to achieve security objectives by 
understanding the purpose and impact of security controls on business processes or IT systems. 
 
 
Security integration across layers of the architecture is essential to ensure the protection of information 
and IT assets. Security must start at the business layer and work its way down to the application and 
infrastructure layers. 
 
 
 
At the high level, t
he SRM relationship and tie

Linking security and privacy to agency enterprise architecture, including agency performance 
objectives, 
business
 
processes, data flows, applications and infrastructure 
technologies, ensures that each aspect of 
the business receives appropriate security and privacy considerations.  Additionally, addressing security 
and privacy through enterprise architecture promotes interoperability and aids in the standardization and 
co
nsolidation of security and privacy capabilities.

Cloud Computing

Special Publication 800
-

Cloud Computing Synopsis and Recommendations
 
 
Th
e full document can be obtained at 
http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html
 
 
Cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, on
-
demand network access to a shared pool of 
configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applicat
ions, and services) that can 
be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. This 
Alliant 2 
Small Business GWAC

cloud model is composed of five essential characteristics, three service models, and four deployment 
models.
 
 
Cloud Essent
ial Characteristics
 
 
On
-
demand self
-
service: A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server 
time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each 

 
 
Broad network acc
ess: Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard 
mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, 
tablets, laptops, and workstations).
 
 

computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a 
multi
-
tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned 
according to consumer demand. There is a sense of location independence in that the cus
tomer generally 
has no control or knowledge over the exact location of the provided resources but may be able to specify 
location at a higher level of abstraction (e.g., country, state, or datacenter). Examples of resources 
include storage, processing, mem
ory, and network bandwidth.
 
 
Rapid elasticity: Capabilities can be rapidly and elastically provisioned, in some cases automatically, to 
scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand. To the consumer, the capabilities 
available for provisioning 
often appear to be unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any 
time.
 
 
Measured Service: Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a 
metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of s
ervice (e.g., storage, 
processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts). Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and 
reported, providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service.
 
Cloud Service Models
 
 
Cloud Software as a
 
Service (SaaS):
 

applications running on a cloud infrastructure. The applications are accessible from various client devices 
through a thin client interface such as a Web browser (e.g., Web
-
b
ased email), or a program interface. 
The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, 
operating systems, storage, or even individual application capabilities, with the possible exception of 
limited use
r
-
specific application configuration settings.
 
 
Cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS
). The capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud 
infrastructure consumer
-
created or 
-
acquired applications created using programming languages and 
tools 
supported by the provide. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud 
infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, or storage, but has control over the deployed 
applications and possibly application hosting environment con
figurations.
 
 
Cloud Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).
 
The capability provided to the consumer is to provision 
processing, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources where the consumer is able 
to deploy and run arbitrary software, which 
can include operating systems and applications. The 
consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but has control over operating 
systems, storage, deployed applications; and possibly limited control of select networking components
 
(e.g., host firewalls).

The following is excerpt from that preliminary release. 
 
The 
full content can be viewed at through the following web site:

Big data consists 
of advanced techniques that harness independent resources for building scalable data 
systems when the characteristics of the datasets require new architectures for efficient storage, 
manipulation, and analysis.

GWAC contract overview training leading to a written Delegation o
f Procurement 

Ordering Contracting Officers (OCOs), and is required prior to awarding and for administering Orders.
 
 
The OCO training and written delegation
 
requirement
s
 
are beneficial because DPAs provide a clearly 
structured 
understanding of
 
roles and responsibilities between the Master Contract Contracting Officer(s) 
and OCOs, resulting 
in a
 
positive take away for all stakeholders. The training and DPA ari

obligations to the Office of Management and Budget, are consistent with Section 865 of the Duncan 
Hunter National Defense Authorization Act of 2009, P.L. 110
-

in
-
line with the related recommendation of t
he Acquisition Advisory Panel/SARA Panel (authorized by 
Section 1423 of the Services Acquisition Reform Act of 2003).
 
 
While delegation can only be granted to warranted Contracting Officers, all individuals (i.e. project 
managers, program officials, etc.) 
involved with a Task Order are encouraged to participate in the 
training.

walk Matrix is a cross reference library of Standard IT Service 
LCATs that will help the GWAC Program and Contractors correlate to their

labor titles and descriptions to those used by the Department of Labor Standard Occupational 
Classification (DOL SOC) and those currently adopted as Standard IT Service LCATs on the Master 
Contract (see Section J
-

LCATS). The i
nformation contained within the Standard IT Service LCATs 
Cross

walk Matrix may be shared on the GSA GWAC Webpage.
 
 
 
Due to varied commercial labor titles across all Contractors, the Standard IT Service LCAT Cross
-
walk 
Matrix will help to prevent inadverte
nt inclusion of new IT Service LCATs, containing similar functional 

Contract Standard IT Service LCATs. 
 
If one or more of the Contractors cannot agree to the p
roposed IT 
Service LCAT matching to the DOL/SOC or the Master Contract, the proposed IT Service LCAT 
determination will be unilaterally made by the GSA GWAC Program to classify the proposed IT Service 
LCAT to the DOL SOC and the Master Contract.

(CPARS)
 
 
Past performance information is relevant for future Task Order source selection purposes. It includes, but 

d to standards of good 


customer satisfaction; and generall

-
like concern for the interests of the 
customer.
 
 
Pursuant to FAR Part 42.1502, the Government will conduct past performance assessments on 
Contractors. Interim performance evaluations should be conducted as prescribed by the Ta
sk Order 

event that an OCO does not perform an assessment for a qualified Task Order that requires an 
assessment every 12 months, the Contractor should re
quest the OCO for an assessment, or notify the 
GWAC Program for further assistance. As a Best Practice, the performing Prime Contractor may 
voluntarily provide to the OCO an 
objective quality write
-
up to include, at a minimum, scope of work 
performed, and 
timeliness and quality of deliverable and services.
 
 
Contractors may access evaluations through a secure website for review and comment at the following 
address: https://www.cpars.gov/. Past performance evaluations pertaining to the Master Contract and 
Ord
ers under the Master Contract will reside in the Past Performance Information Retrieval System 
(PPIRS).  The PPIRS functions as the central warehouse for performance assessment reports received 
from various Federal performance information collection system
s.  
 
 
 
To insure highest quality performance standards of the 
Alliant 2 Small Business
 
GWAC 
Contractors, 
Contractors shall notify the GWAC Program whenever 
Marginal/Unsatisfactory ratings
 
are assigned to 
any of the performance criteria established at the O

In accordance with the 13 CFR 125.6 and FAR Clause 52.219
-
14, Limitation on Subcontracting, a small 
business concern contracting for services will perform at least 50 percent of cost of the contract inc
urred 
for personnel with its own employees. The contractor is responsible for managing the balance of workload 
being performed under this contract. 
 
 
 
The contractor is responsible for performing greater than 50% of the cost of the contract incurred for 
pe
rsonnel with its own employees at the contract level and not necessarily on individual Task Orders.  
Notwithstanding this, the contractor is required to perform a meaningful amount of work on each Task 
Order to prevent pass

MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS,
 
NOVATIONS, AND CHANGE
-
OF
-
NAME AGREEMENTS
 
 
The Anti
-
Assignment of Contracts Act, 41 USC § 15, (Anti
-
Assignment Act) prohibits the transfer of any 
interest in a federal contract to another party unless an exception applies. Therefore, the Master Contract, 
s
tanding alone, is not a commodity that can be bought, sold or assigned to a brokerage firm or any third 
party agent so to arrange transactions between a buyer and a seller of standalone Government contracts. 
There are conditions, however, where the Governm
ent may 
still recognize a successor
-
in
-
interest who, 
due to certain transfers, is in a position to continue performance in place of the original party to the 
Government contract.
 
For example, through a (1) Novation Agreement where the sale of all Contracto

assets, or the entire portion of the assets involved in
 
performing the Master Contract
, including any open 
Task Orders
, 
has occurred. An Assignment that would otherwise be considered ineffective, may be given 
effect via a novation agreement that substi
tutes successor
-
in
-
interest as the contractor, while requiring 
that the original party remain obligated for performance
. Another example of an exception to the Anti
-
Assignment Act is through (2) Operation of Law, such as when the Contractor

 
interest in 
the contract is 
transferred as a result of a stock purchase or bankruptcy order.
 
These exceptions are further discussed 
below:
 
 

 
Novation
: The Contractor (Transferor) must always obtain the Government's consent and 
approval for a Novation, including the Gov

(Transferee). 
 
Although the Transferor and the Transferee may have negotiated their corporate 
terms and conditions 
for the terms of assignment or assumption of responsibilities relating to the 
Government Contr
act,
 
and agreed to execute a Novation Agreement substantially in conformance 
with the regulatory requirement, 
the Novation is not automatically approved by the 
Government. 
 
There are no entitlements or guarantees that the Government must or will consent 
to
 
any request for Novation. 
 
 
FAR 42.12 describes the procedures necessary to request that the Government recognize a 
successor in interest to a contract. There are also additional due diligence procedures that GSA 
may impose, including an evaluation of the
 

systems, relevant past contract performance, financial capacity, and other Responsibility factors. 
From the time the Government receives a completed Novation package request from the 
Transferor, the process 
might take three to six months or more for the Government to process the 
package and provide a decision. The Contractor must continue to fully perform under the terms 
Alliant 2

and conditions of the Master Contract throughout the entire period of time the Novation p
ackage 
awaits a final decision from the Alliant ACO or PCO. If the GSA determines that the Novation 

under the Master Contract. 
 
All open Task Orders from th
e transferor shall also be Novated to the 

 
 
Operation of Law
: With this exception, the Master Contract continues with the same entity after closing. 
As an example, the exception applies for changes in owne
rship as a result of a stock purchase, with no 
legal change in the party to the Government contract, and when that contracting party remains in control 
of the assets and is the party performing the contract. Although Government consent is not required, 
oth
er FAR regulations and GSA supplemental policies require notice of ownership changes to the 
Government (See the below paragraph within this section)
.
 
Furthermore, if the party to the Government 
contract desires to have a new stock owner substituted as a pa
rty to the
 
contract, the requirements of a 
novation would then apply.
 
There are also other circumstances, such as when assignment occurs as part 
of a bankruptcy restructuring, where outright Assignment of the government contract is effected by order 
of a c
ourt of competent jurisdiction, and authorized by federal law. In such cases, the Assignment does 
not violate the Anti
-
Assignment Act and the Novation submission requirements are adjusted to reflect the 
nature of the transfer. Novation in such cases still 
acts to formally recognize the successor
-
in
-
interest via 
modification to the contract, and depending on the operation of law, may be effected without the consent 
or agreement of the original contractor.

Only One Master Contract Permitted
: 
The Contractor, either 
directly or 
through its parent, affiliates,

TASK ORDER CLOSEOUT
 
 
 
The OCO is responsible for closing out individual Task Orders under the Master Contract. 
 
The Contr
actor 
agrees to cooperate with the OCO to close out Orders as soon as practical after expiration, cancellation 
or termination of each Task Order. In the event the Contractor cannot locate the current OCO to close out 
the Task Order, the Contractor may requ
est assistance from the GSA GWAC Administrative Contracting
 
Officer (ACO) to locate an ordering agency representative to close out the Orders.
  
Task Order closeout 
will be accomplished within the guidelines set forth in: 
 
FAR Part 4 Administrative Matters 
and FAR Part 
42 Contract Administration and Audit Services.
 
 
OCOs are encouraged to utilize FAR 42.708, Quick
-
Closeout Procedures to the maximum extent 
practicable.
 
 
The OCO has the authority to negotiate settlement of indirect costs in advance of the dete
rmination of 
final indirect cost rates if the Order is physically complete and the amount of unsettled indirect cost to be 
allocated to the Order is relatively insignificant (See FAR 42.708(a)(2)).
 
 
The Contractor shall make a good faith effort to expedite
 
DCMA audits. 
 
Any individual Task Order with 
obligated funding may be unilaterally deobligated and closed after six years and three months by the 
OCO.

of
 
the period of performance shall be submitted to the OCO as a claim.

without waiting for the OCO to
 
issue closeout modifications to their Task Orders. Task Order awards and 
obligations reported in the GSA 
Government Designated Reporting System
 
will be compared to records 
found in the Federal Procurement Database System, and other available government sy
stems. The GSA 
GWAC Program will review periodically the overpayment/ underpayment of the Contract Access Fee from 
expired Task Orders and reconcile any discrepancies with the Contractors in advance of the Master 
Contract closeout. As requested by the Prog
ram Office, Contractors shall insure corrections to Order, 
Invoice and CAF Data is accomplished with the date specified in Section F.7.
 
 
Upon mutual agreement by both the Government and the Contractor, entitlement to any residual dollar 
amount of $1,000 or
 
less at the time of final contract closeout may be waived. "Residual dollar amount" 
means money owed to either party at the end of the contract and as a result of the contract, excluding 
liabilities relating to taxation or a violation of law or regulation
. 
 
In determining a residual dollar amount, 
the Government and the Contractor may agree to consider offsets to the extent consistent with law and 
regulation.
 
 
Any and all Contractor claims at the Master Contract level against the GSA GWAC Program shall be 
submitted, in writing, to the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO) for a decision within 1 year after accrual 
of the claim(s) or 6 months after the Contractor's final Task Order is physically completed, whichever 
occurs first. Furthermore, the Contractor sh
all pursue any claims it may have at the Order level through 
the ordering activity and not with the GSA GWAC Program. If no claim is submitted in this specified time 
frame, the Contractor shall issue a formal (signed by an agent that is authorized to repre
sent the 
Contractor) Master Contract Release of Claim and confirmation that the Contract Access Fee has been 
paid for all identified Task Orders, no later than 30 days after the deadline to submit a claim has elapsed.

overtime work in advance, overtime rates shall be negotiated.
 
(2) Failure to agree upon these overtime rates shall be treated as a dispute under the

usage
 

If this is an
 

list separately

use
 
its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all ob

contract
 
within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly 
rate
 
payments and material costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 
30
 
days, if added to all other
 
payments and costs previously accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the
 
ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised
 
estimate of the total price to the Government for performing this contract with suppor

Contracting
 
Officer, giving a revised estimate of the total price for performing this contract, with

reasons and documentation. If at any time during performance of this contract, the 
Government has
 
reason to believe that the work to be required in performing this contract will be 
substantially greater
 
or less than the stated ceiling price, the Contracting Officer will so advise the 
Contractor, giving the
 
then revised estimate of the total amount of e

excess 
of the ceiling price in the Schedule, and the Contractor shall not be obligated to continue
 
performance if to do so 
would exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule, unless and until the
 
Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor in writing that the ceiling price has been increased and
 
specifies in the notice a revised ceiling that shall constitute the ceiling 
price for performance under
 
this contract. When and to the extent that the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule has been
 
increased, any hours expended and material costs incurred by the Contractor in excess of the
 
ceiling price before the increase shall
 
be allowable to the same extent as if the hours expended and
 
material costs had been incurred after the increase in the ceiling price.
 
(4) Access to records. At any time before final payment under this contract, the Contracting
 
Officer 
(or authorized repr

reduction to 
the extent of amounts, on preceding invoices, that are found by the Contracting Officer
 
not to have 
been properly payable and
 
shall also be subject to reduction for overpayments or to
 
increase for 
underpayments. The Contractor shall promptly pay any such reduction within 30 days
 
unless the 
parties agree otherwise. The Government within 30 days will pay any such increases,

Volume 1 
-
 
The Joint Venture must fill out and submit the Representations and Certifications in 
Section K. Each member of the Joint Ventu
re must also submit their individual 
Representations and Certifications in Section K. All other elements submitted for Volume 1 
must be in the name of the joint venture.
 

 
Volume 2 
-
 
Relevant experience projects may be in the name of the joint venture or in 
the name 
of an individual member of the joint venture.
 

 
Volume 3 
-
 
Past performance examples may be in the name of the joint venture or in the name 
of an individual member of the joint venture.
 

 
Volume 4 
-
 
Offerors submitting as a joint venture must provide 
evidence of the system, 
certification, or clearance being in the name of the joint venture or in the name of every 
member of the joint venture. This applies to all systems, certifications, and clearances within 
section L.5.4. For certifications with varyin
g levels (e.g. CMMI Levels 2 and 3), scoring will

the Army) 
would qualify as two Federal Government Customers. Submitting 
 
two relevant experience projects with 
Funding Agency ID 4732 (GSA/Federal Acquisition Service) would only qualify as one Federal 
Government Customer and the second project with the sa
me Funding Agency ID would not meet the 
requirements of this section for additional scoring.

PAST PERFORMANCE FOR RELEVANT EXPERIENCE PROJECTS
 
Past performance will be evaluated using projects submitted under L.5.2.2 PSC Group Relevant 
Experience.  A past performance assessment must be submitted for each relevant 
experience project 
submitted under L.5.2.2.  
No Past Performance submissions are required or requested for any LET 
projects under L.5.2.3 Leading Edge Technology Relevant Experience.  
Acceptable forms of past 
performance assessments are detailed below in L
.5.3.1 and L.5.3.2. 
 
For the relevant past performance references, Offerors are strongly cautioned that inability of the 
Government to contact past performance references directly associated to any survey; or, in the case 
past performance information is no
t entered into the Past Performance Information Retrieval System 
(PPIRS) database; or, in the case of project(s) without a record of past performance, the Offeror will not 
be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.
 
Only
 
in the event PPIRS i
nformation is 
not
 
available will an Offeror be allowed to substitute a Past 
Performance Survey similar to the CPARS format.  If PPIRS information is available for any given 
relevant project, it 
must
 
be used for the Past Performance evaluation.
 
L.5.3.1
 
 
Past Performance ((PPIRS) information 
exists
)
 
If the Government has 
interim or final 
ratings in PPIRS,
 
the Offeror shall provide a copy of this rating 
with their proposal. The Government will retrieve past performance information from the PPIRS database 
th
at links to the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) in order to validate the 

used on a relevant experience project. If a fina
l rating is not available, the most 
current
 
past performance 
information will be used. Offerors are responsible for verifying whether past performance ratings exist in 
the PPIRS database prior to using Past Performance Surveys.
 
L.5.3.2
 
 
Past Performance (P
PIRS information does 
not
 
exist)
 
If the Government has not finalized past performance ratings in the PPIRS database that links to CPARS; 
or, if the project(s) are considered Non
-
U.S. Federal projects; the Offeror shall submit a certified Past 
Performance S
urvey using the template in Section J.P
-

, the Offeror shall provide the survey directly to 
ea
ch of the references. The Past Performance Rating Form must be completed and signed by a 
Warranted Contracting Officer with cognizance over the submitted project. For a commercial project, the 
Past Performance Rating Form must be completed and signed by a 
Corporate Officer/Official
 
of the 
customer with cognizance over the submitted project.
 
The Offeror shall instruct each rater to send a completed form directly back to the Offeror;
 
The Offeror must follow up with each rater to ensure the Past Performance Ra
ting Forms were received 
and completed prior to the proposal closing date.
 
The Offeror must submit all Past Performance Rating Forms, as applicable, with their proposal 
submission.
 
In the event the evaluation team discovers misleading, falsified, and/or fr
audulent past performance 
ratings, the Offeror shall be eliminated from further consideration for award. Falsification of any proposal 
submission, documents, or statements may subject the Offeror to civil or criminal prosecution under 
Section 1001 of Title
 
18 of the United States Code.

Cost Accounting System and Audit Information
 
 
If claiming credit for this scoring element, the Offeror must provide verification from the Defense Cont
ract 
Audit Agency (DCAA), Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), or any Cognizant Federal 
Agency (CFA) of an acceptable accounting system that has been 
audited
 
and determined adequate for 
determining costs applicable to the contract or order in accorda
nce with FAR 16.301
-
3(a)(3).  The offeror 
must certify that there have been no material changes to the accounting system since the last audit of its 
accounting system.
 
 
 
Offerors shall provide the 
DUNS and CAGE Code of the Business Entity that is being cre
dited, and 
name, 
address, phone number, and email of the representative at their cognizant DCAA and DCMA Offices or 
CFA and submit, if available, a copy of a Pre

Award Survey of Prospective Contractor Accounting System 
(SF 1408).  In lieu of the SF 1408 th
e offeror may submit a letter received from the auditing agency, on 

accounting system was audited and determined adequate for cost reimbursement contracting.  I
f both the 
SF 1408 and auditing agency letter exists, submit both with the offer.
 
 
 
If an Offeror(s) does not have audit verification of an adequate accounting system to submit, but is certain 
its accounting system has been audited and determined adequate 
in accordance with FAR 16.301
-
3(a)(3), GSA will contact the Cognizant auditing representative office, that was provided, to verify.  It is 
the Offerors responsibility to provide the Government current and correct contact information.  If after 
reasonable e
fforts the Government is unable to obtain audit verification from the contact provided, points 
for an adequate accounting system cannot be earned.

Alliant 2 Small Business
 
GWAC, plus an additional 5 years to cover any Task Order that has a term 
beyond the Basic Term plus the Option.
 
 
The Offeror shall propose ceiling rates for T&M/L
-
H task orders by completing the Cost/Price Template as 
instructed in L.5.5.2.3. These ceiling rates are to be based upon the highest qualified employee within a 
given labor category, working in the highest 
paid area within CONUS, on a highly complex requirement, 
excluding
 
Top Secret/SCI/or higher.
 
 
Offerors 
shall
 
only provide the ceiling rates for Year 1 of the contract with a Start Date of (To Be 
Determined).
  
Ceiling rates for Years 2 through 10 (which inc
ludes the years 2 through 5 of the initial 
base period and the 5
-
year option period) will automatically be calculated for each labor category by an 
escalation factor embedded in the spreadsheet. 
Offerors shall 
not
 
change the escalation factor in the 
spread
sheet
. This escalation factor is determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Employment 
Cost Index (ECI) and is based on the average annual BLS ECI for the previous three years from the date 
the 
Alliant
 
2 Small Business

solicitation is issued. 
The current BLS ECI 3 year average is 1.80%.  
As indicated in Section B.

BASIS FOR AWARDS
 
 
The source selection process on the 
Alliant 2 Small Business
 
GWAC will neither be based on the Lowest 
Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) nor Tradeoffs.  Within the best value continuum, FAR 15.101 
defines best value as using any one or a combination of source selection approaches. For the Master 
Contract, the 
High
est Technically Rated Offerors with a Fair and Reasonable Price
 
will determine the best 
value basis for contract awards. 
 
 
The Highest Technically Rated, Fair and Reasonable Price approach will best achieve the objective of 
awarding contracts to Offerors o
f Information Technology Services Solutions expertise with qualities that 
are most important to GSA and its agency customers, including Past Performance, Relevant Experience, 
and Systems, Certifications and Clearances.
 
 
The GWAC Program will issue Multiple
 
Awards to a maximum of 80 contractors. Even if there is a single 
point difference between Offeror 
8
0 and Offer 
8
1, only the Offeror in the 
8
0th position will receive an 
award.  In the event of a tie at the maximum number 
8
0 position, all Offerors tied 
at 
the 80
th
 
position 
will 
receive an award. 

receive an identical score. 
 
If a tie score occurs at any other position before the 80th position, the tie does 
not result in two
 
or more Offerors holding that same numbered position. For example, if two Offerors 
reach an identical score at the 39th available position, one tied Offeror will take the 39th position and the 
second tied Offeror moves into the 40th position.
 
 
 
 
The 
Government will strictly enforce all of the proposal submission requirements outlined in Section L. 

materially non
-
conforming to solicitation requirement
s.
 
 
The Government intends to award contracts without discussions. Initial proposals must contain the best 
offer. The Government may conduct clarifications, as described in FAR 15.306(a). The Government 
reserves the right to conduct discussions if 
determined necessary.

SCREENING AND EVALUATION PROCESS
 
 
The first step in the evaluation process will be to order the offers from highest score to lowest score solely 

Document Verification and Self Scoring Worksheet
 
(Section J.P
-

)
. 
 
 
At this point the evaluation team will establish the preliminary top 
8
0
, hereafter
 
referred to as Top 
8
0.  A 
screening process of the Top 
8
0 will commence to verify that a support document exists for all the 
 
Page 
143
 
of 149
 
 
evaluation elements in accordance with the O

submitted in accordance with Section J.P
-

. Any discrepancies will be treated as clarifications.
 
 
The evaluation team will then initially 
verify
 
that those top offerors up to a maximum of 
8
0 awards have 
also successfully passed all of the Acceptability Review requirements in Section M.4 of the solicitation.  
 
 
Any Offeror in the Top 
8
0 based upon score, who fails the Acceptability Review, will be removed from 
consideration for award and noti
fied, in writing, as soon as practicable. The next highest rated Offeror(s) 
(based upon score) who passes the Acceptability Review shall be added in the eliminated Offerors place. 
Only Offerors who initially pass all the criteria in the Acceptability Revie
w in accordance with Section M.4. 
shall be considered eligible for award.  
 
 
Following the Acceptability Review screening, the evaluation team will then 
evaluate and verify
 
the 
support documentation for each and every evaluation element that the Top 
8
0 hav

Document Verification and Self Scoring Worksheet (Section J.P
-
1
).
 
 
In the event that an evaluation element claimed is unsubstantiated or otherwise not given credit for, the 

 
the refuted evaluation element deducted and the 
Offeror will be re
-
sorted based upon the revised preliminary score.  If the Offeror remains in the Top 
8
0 
the evaluation of the offer shall continue.  If the Offeror does not remain in the Top 
8
0, the evalua
tion for 
that offer will stop and the next highest rated Offeror (based upon score) who passes the Acceptability 
Review shall be added to the Top 
8
0 and evaluation shall begin on that offer.
 
 
Once the Top 
8
0 highest scored offers have been evaluated and va
lidated, the evaluation team will then 
check to verify that these Offerors have proposed fair and reasonable pricing.  In the event that an Offeror 
has not provided fair and reasonable pricing, the Offeror shall be eliminated from further consideration for
 
award unless discussions are conducted.  However, the 
Alliant 2 Small Business
 
GWAC CO plans on 
basing award on initial proposals and does not intend on conducting discussions as stated in Section M.2.
 
 
The evaluation process shall continue this cycle unt
il the Top 
8
0 apparent successful Offerors are 
identified that represent the highest technically rated offers (based on validated scores) with a fair and 
reasonable price. In the event of a tie at the position of number 
8
0, all Offerors tied for this posit
ion shall 
receive a contract award. As stated in M.2 above, even if there is a single point difference between 
Offeror 
8
0 and Offeror 
8
1, only the Offeror in the 
8
0th position will receive an award.
 
 
Once the Top 
8
0 have been accomplished, evaluations will
 
cease and contract awards will be issued.
 
 
In the event the evaluation team discovers misleading, falsified, and/or fraudulent proposal information or 
support, the Offeror shall be eliminated from further consideration for award. Falsification of any 
proposal 
submission, documents, or statements may subject the Offeror to civil or criminal prosecution under 
Section 1001 of Title 18 of the United States Code.

Past Performance
 
The Offeror must ensure all the requested proposal

Form.
 
 
Fo
r any proposals that do not include a past performance assessment for each PSC Project, GSA will 
attempt to obtain a past performance assessment from PPIRS or the provided reference. 
 
 
Inability of the Government to contact past performance references dire
ctly associated to any survey may 
result in the survey not being evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. Furthermore, the 
offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance in the case of an offeror 
without a record 
of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not 
available.

M.5.2.1 Evaluation Ratings for PSC Project Past Performance Submissions
 
 
Each past performance assessment submitted will be scored as either Positive or Negative:
 
 
1. POSITIVE = Any overall PSC Project performance rating equal to or greater than a Satisfactory, 
including Very Good and Excellent. Maximum points are earned for a single past performance 
assessment.
 
 
2. NEGATIVE = Any overall PSC Project performance rati
ng less than a Satisfactory, including Marginal 
and Unsatisfactory. No points are earned for a single past performance assessment.
 
 
Positive past performance is defined as receiving a satisfactory 
or 
greater rating for the majority of rating 
elements on a 
PSC Project.
 
M.5.2.2 Points Assigned to PSC Project Past Performance Assessments
 
 
Offerors will be scored in accordance with Section M.6., Scoring Table. Each past performance 
assessment will be scored as Positive or Negative. Past performance projects rec
eiving a positive rating 
will earn the maximum points available based on the total number of past performance assessments 
submitted. Zero points will be earned for a negative rating. 
  
 
 
If the Offeror is submitting less than seven PSC Projects, or a past 
performance assessment is unable to 
be obtained for a submitted PSC Project, the per project point values will be adjusted to equal the 
maximum points possible for this factor.
 
 
A total of 17,500 Points are designated to this Past Performance evaluation fa
ctor, regardless of the 
number of past performance assessments received. The points available per assessment is dependent 
upon the number of assessments received. For example, if 7 assessments are received, each 
assessment will be worth 2,500 points. If 4 
assessments are received, each assessment will be worth 
4,375 points. In either situation, a total of 17,500 points are available for this factor.

If an Offeror does not meet one or more of these parameters for any labor category, the Offeror is 
strongly advised to provide clear and convincing rationale to support the proposed direct/indirect and/or 
profit rate(s).  In the event the rationale is not 
determined reasonable, the proposal will be deemed to 
have a 
maximum
 
rate(s) that is 
not
 
considered fair and reasonable and the proposal would not be eligible 
for award, regardless of technical score. 
 
 
Cost/Price proposals may only be modified as a result of discussions and Offerors are advised that the 
Government intends to make award based on initial proposals without discussions. 
 
 
An offer may also be rejected if any one or more required submittals i
